###Interview protocols. 

>Simulate interviews with at least four different user roles (e.g., waiter, restaurant manager, ...) Each interview protocol must include at least 20 question-answer pairs. NOTE: The main learning experience here is about asking good questions and simulating the interview situation. It's not so important what exactly the content of the answers of the simulated user role is in terms of the kind of features he wants to have. However, it is important that you manage to make the user role formulate precise statements (i.e., not ambiguous, not contradictory, not incomplete). And by the way, this is just a preparatory exercise - you will get modified requirements from an expert in one of the future labs.

**Waiter**  
>*Waiter shall be able to enter and track orders.*   
>*Waiter shall be able to perform billing and accept payments.*

1. Must clients pay for the order immediately after its entered to the system or can the bill be left open?
2. Must an open bill have a limit? If so, will it depend on the client? Can the limit be increased if client is using an accepted credit card?
3. Can the bill be divided into several bills later?
4. Should waiters be able to hand the bill over to the other waiter?
5. Should we support credit cards at all? Which credit cards?
6. Should we support debit cards at all? Which ones?
7. Are there any differences in the mentioned operations between different countries? 
8. Must there be a possibility of reopening closed order?
9. Is it nessecary to have gift as payment method?
10. How should the orders be tracked? By table number?
11. Can the order be discounted? If so, should the discounts be predefined or can it be manually typed by the waiter?

###List of user roles. 
>Note that different user roles perform different functions with the system (for example: waiter needs the function 'client card must give 10% discount before the bill is printed'). The total number of roles to define is up to you.

###Functional requirements the software must support. 
>Requirements must be in harmony with interview protocols described above. Your team should find at least 50 functional requirements for the software to be created.

###SMART requirements to usability and performance. 
>(Hint - the requirement “System must work fast” is not an acceptable performance requirement). Your team should find at least 5 requirements to usability and 5 requirements to performance.
